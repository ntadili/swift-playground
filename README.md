## ðŸ“‚ Projects

- [BMI Calculator](Projects/BMI-Calculator/README.md)  
  A simple iOS app that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on weight and height, then provides fun health feedback.  
  Built with **UIKit** and following the **MVC design pattern**.

## ðŸŒ± More to come
This repo will keep growing as I build new apps while learning Swift and iOS development. Stay tuned!
